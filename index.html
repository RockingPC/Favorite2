      <p>I love reading books. My first teacher who taught me my first words was my Mother because of her I can read. She taught me reading and writing since I was in Senior KG. I felt so good. She is the best teacher ever.                         Whenever I'm free I take a book like Heidi or Through the looking glass or 100 Arabian Nights Stories or Kindle Stories. I also have some knowledge books like Flowers and trees, Insect World, Our Body, Life in Water, Everyday life, Things around us, Wheels and Wings, Sky and Earth, Animal friends, Nature. Reading is better than just sitting in front of the TV or PC and watching a movie or series. There are so many things in books. They tell us about the world and let us explore. We can also write an interesting story book by using our imagination. Writing Books is all about having imagination. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in life.</p>
